## Reflection Document

### HTML

It was a nice useful lab for getting started with various elements of html.

### Accessibility

This lab was nice just for knowing how to use WAVE, I kind of wish the issues were a bit more significant.

### CSS

Doing this my first time I did a lot of things wrong I noticed when running through all the labs again. Solving the issues in these problems were a lot simpler than my brain was thinking before and I did a ton of round-about fixes my first time around.

### Flexbox

I kinda wish there was more direction in this lab, it was really hard at the start to figure out how to do a lot of these kinda layouts with flexbox alone. I still feel like I did a bunch of them wrong but websites like https://flexbox.help helped me figure out some of them.

### CSS Grids

This lab was really nice for just learning how the grids work, I honestly was expecting flex to work more like these grids when wanting to work on them before. I believe I missed the lecture for these, so I had to mostly figure out how to do it myself but it was a fun experience.

### Bootstrap

This lab was a nice introduction to a bunch of bootstrap elements. I almost did 03-grid wrong because I thought I had to use mediaqueries for it, I didn't quite understand that bootstrap had mediaquery classes that handled it for you. The modal one was nice but I honestly feel like it could of been the first one, since it was a lot simpler than the cards and grid and just needed me to lookup how to properly make a modal in bootstrap.

### Javascript

I enjoyed most of this lab as a nice introduction to a bunch of javascript features but I feel I didn't much enjoy the 06-fetch one due to the amount of having to design a layout for this, I wish I didn't have to insert the elements for the book myself and it was just a lab on learning how to use fetch. It just made it take a bit more time than expected.

### JQuery

Skipped.
